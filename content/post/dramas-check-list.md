A list of TV series I would like to watch / have watched, and a short comments on them, by category.
<!--more-->

Disclaimer: It is just a personal comment without thinking through, I simply wrote them for fun. 
A lot of grammatical mistakes could be generated in the process, and probably some irresponsible 
comments also.

### Pandora

I have always a soft spot for sci-fi genres. Inter-celestial interactions, spaceships and
questioning the existence of human beings, but most importantly, the world that is shaped
in the series. 

I have only watched the pilot for this show, and unfortunately I will not watch this 
unless I am super slack. The story settings are ok, nothing new but nothing bad, actually I was
excited for a while when I saw an academy teaching proper imagined courses such as 
`inter-celestial protocols` and a history of earth, in the form of holograms and VRs.
For a while I thought this is a teenage story that baked with sci-fi elements - very good for 
a not-so-young man like me.

However, what annoys me is the narrative (Ah yeah it is usually the narrative), I have no idea that
suddenly the female protagonist had already spent the first three months in the academy,
and I understand the needs of explaining the world and stories via narrative, and speeding up
the pace to unravel the meaning of `Pandora`, but still I feel fractal.

I must confess, that it did not impress me, but it does not mean that is not going to be a good
 show. I have hated `Person of Interest` for the first two seasons before I really started to enjoy
 it.
