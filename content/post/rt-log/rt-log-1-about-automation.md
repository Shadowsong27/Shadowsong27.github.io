I will have some random thoughts here and there. This is a new series of logs, which will be short. 
<!--more-->

It has been more than one year since I returned to the position of a data engineer.  After a detour, I ended up doing exactly what I initially love to do - building automation tools and pipelines.

Automation always has been attractive for me because it grants me some  unfathomable sense of satisfaction when I watch processes and tasks are executed strictly adhering to your design. I probably got this feeling when I was developing crawlers back in the days and watching data cleaned, structured and stored in a database. It is exactly like (agriculture) farming, but with a much timely feedback. 

I tend to believe that video games like Factorio had developed my likings for the conquering of manual repetition during my pre-uni time. I am not a fan of programming even though I have started it at the age of 11. Apparently solving algorithmic problem using Pascal in a blue screen was not as fun as trying to score full marks in exams in middle school. Programming started to become fun when it becomes useful to me, that’s how I discovered I am definitely a utilitarian. 

Don’t get me wrong, I am not looking down on the manual labour or anything alike, and on the contrary, it is exactly the repetitive labours and endurance of boredom and hardship that helped build what humans now have, many of which are unfortunately taken for granted.

It is fun to build automation tools, however recently I did not have much time or thoughts to think and design certain tools. I realise even though I love such practices - hobby projects and stuff, my mental stamina has been drained during my work time (especially this week). I have to admit that age had gotten the best of me (speaking at the age of 24, which is old enough to understand what is old). You start to appreciate youth once it was truly gone, sadly. 

What is the purpose of life then, if not doing things that we love. To truly achieve that, we do things and only once in life, and use automation to buy us more time in the world.

Hopefully I can still be this optimistic at the age of 25.
