The battle against the fearful death himself is an everlasting one, and today we are, after seventeen years, effortless watching another heavy strike laid upon us. Well, to be more specific, mostly the people lived in China and who had been to China during this unfortunate period. 
<!--more-->

It saddens me to see that we had not learnt enough from the previous fights to contain it more effectively this time. And it saddens me even more to see doctors, who have fought valiantly at the frontiers, who deserved the most protection, support and respect, are stabbed and murdered in broad daylight. 

I have always considered myself a selfish person, that means I do not resonate normally with tragedies that do not impact me directly. A nice way to put this when I am actually talking with acquaintances: I am politically neutral and detached. 

A few weeks before the outbreak I went to a hospital for health screening. There are a few things that I felt strongly uncomfortable. 

1. The light in the hall way was not working, the paint on the wall were full of scratches

2. While I was doing my teeth polishing, patients waiting and relatives were standing there blatantly, probably observing my cleaning process

I don’t really care my privacy that much in this particular case, nor the interior design of the hospital. 
The first point shows that, IMHO, the budget for the (public) hospital is just not sufficient to even consider a renovation, 
and the second point scares me the most: patients, or even random people could just walked into a room that is full of medical equipments. Yes I know Stomatology department is probably ok to be less strict , which probably proves my first point regarding the limited medical resource in China.

Let’s hope for the best, and let’s hope this serve as yet another warning for the rising tensions between patients and doctors.
