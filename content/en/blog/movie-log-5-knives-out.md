I have been on some sort of movie spree for a few nights in a row, without dropping my piano practices of course, and I ran into this movie called __Knives Out__ a few hours ago. 
<!--more-->

I did not realise this is a mystery / crime solving movie until I saw Harlan committed “suicide” (I thought this is comedy because I was browsing a list of comedies in 2019 a few days back).

The story is pretty twisted, and good. As a person who had some liking for deductions (to make myself feel smart), this story did trick me a bit. It has three layer of puzzles, or “donuts” quoting from the movie, but I guess I SHALL NOT be a spoiler by talking about the story or the answers behind all those puzzles. I just want to talk about the movie itself.

I am pretty surprised to see many familiar faces, even among the support ing roles. Besides Chris Evans and Daniel Craig, I even spotted Michael Shannon, who also played George Westinghouse in __The Current War__ which I happened to watch last night (I do not why but I am officially making Katherine Waterston in my top 3 actresses in my list after the movie). I guess I have watched enough movies to recognise some other famous actors. To be fair, I do not really like Daniel’s accent, its a bit unnatural in SOME parts of the movie, but it’s Daniel Craig so everything is great. I did not really recognise the female lead initially, but just find her familiar. It turns out she starred in __Bladerunner 2049__ too, which is another movie I found worth rewatching.

A quick description on the story, besides the compelling story and mysteries that driver the characters, especially the female protagonist Marta, in their own developments (I would say all of the supporting roles did a fantastic job in depicting their not-so-lethal grudge with each other), I had to applaud for the details in the movies. Well I know it’s a movie for crime solving and they have to pay extra attention to details to win over the audiences. Still, it does not feel forced, not even for the cup in the end marked with `My house, my rule, my coffee` . Not to mention the word `already` in `Ransom, you came back again already`, and the word / name ransom itself already kind of suggests something (I might be over reading this, oops that’s the spoiler).

This is a really good watch if you are up for some mind twisters, it’s light yet complex enough to be interesting. There is little or none thrilling element so it’s good if you are scared of bodies and blood.
