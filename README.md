# Overview

This repo contains the both the static website materials and the 
builder of my personal blog.

It uses `hugo` instead of `jekyll` now, which actually feels better.

# Build and Deploy (in case I forgot)

- always work on `builder` branch locally

- preview blogs with `hugo serve`

- commit your changes 

- run `bash deploy.sh` 

# Theme - Tranquilpeak
