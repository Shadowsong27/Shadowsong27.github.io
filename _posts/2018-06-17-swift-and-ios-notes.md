### Introduction and Background

After I left my last company, I feel it is the time for me to do something I’d always want to do — build the movie App I like. Being an iPhone and MacBook user for years,  it is natural for me to study Swift and iOS development. Luckily, I kinda find a book in my office when I left, it was left there, perhaps one year ago to lift up monitors. So it starts, the notes and thoughts about Swift programming.

### Chapter 1 - Cocoa Development Tools

This chapter covers the brief history of Cocoa Tools, and some general concepts regarding Xcode and iOS App development in general such  as distribution, which could be found in Apple’s Developer Website in greater details, plus some really really basic hand’s on practice, and of course a tour around the Xcode.

One bad thing about learning programming from book is that you could not simply copy and paste the example codes into the editor, but it is making me to get used to the IDE. Different IDEs have different code competition style and being familiar with that would tremendously increase your productivity, so I am definitely not complaining that. Plus, it always feels good to write in new languages.

With my current understanding, it seems like that the design of iOS App could be separated into two components, the `interface` and the `connections`, which can be then further divided into `outlets` (and a `outlet collections`) and `actions`

I do want to complain about one thing, the book is outdated, like for 2 years I guess. Thus, the example code is also not correct. However, it is not much a big issue because you could always googled out the changes, plus you get to see the “patch notes” in real time.

Lastly regarding TestFlight, I would probably try HockeyApp first, but that is the late stage, let me see how things go first.
