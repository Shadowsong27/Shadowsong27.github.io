After knowing who I am in the blossoming era of tech startups, I have been trying to summarise an universal
workflow for what I am doing everyday. An systematic approach to my work would prevent myself from deviating 
from the original plan. 

# Outline

1. Understanding the Business Requirements

If I were in a larger company, probably I did not even need to think about this, 
because this is the task for product manager. Well I am not, but this is a good 
learning if you have ever thought about being a product manager yourself.

Dealing with the business requirements involves tons of abstract thinking. 
Sometimes the requirements could be very detailed such as “I want a back office 
that could help me send customized notifications to users everyday” or it could be 
very abstracted - “I want to see how we are doing everyday”. After a while I have got 
this feeling that the transformation of a business requirement into a technical requirement 
is definitely not an easy task, and the efficiency of that transformation largely depends on two 
things: how experienced you are in doing similar tasks in the past, and how much (new)
knowledge you have so the solution would be up-to-date, innovative or effective. 
It is not difficult to propose a working solution, it is difficult to propose 
a working solution that will last, at least for a period of time. If you are 
leaving the company in one week, and what you have done has to be redone because 
of the poor choice of tools, logical designs or simply messy coding styles, it is wasting resources.
