I have never considered myself a solid software developer, nor a data scientist. After the first fruitful internship I had last year, I decided to change my work environment. That decision prompted me to apply for an internship in China and that particular technical phone call interview, which could be considered as my first technical interview, reminded me of that I was yet to be production ready. That is why I have decided to dig deeper in programming, plus Python is not a complete stranger to me, hence the book *Fluent Python*.
