This section contains my personal notes for **Data Mining** concepts and techniques in general, written in complete sentences instead of bullet points. It does not officially serve
as a tutorial for beginners, but one may use it as references.

After the final examination of this theory-based course, I suddenly felt a tiny bit of remorse for not studying the MLE concept properly, though I have never imagined myself as a statistician. This is probably the major reason why I am writing all these - combing through my knowledge because they are scattered around in my mind right now.

I have a misconception regarding the term 'data mining' when I started.

The process of gathering data is not part of the data mining process, data mining is about extracting information from data sets, which often are high dimensional and large in volume.

The 4 Vs concept of "Big Data" will not be discussed here, since I do not like the term "Big Data".

I will never be able to finalise the list below because knowledge are evolving constantly, but it will be updated if necessary.

1. Some Statistical Concepts
  * Linear Algebra
  * W
2. Regression
3. Classification
